Project for discussion of the Galam model


This repository explores the Galam model and its dynamics, presenting an introduction to the fundamental model and its extensions emphasizing its potential for capturing opinion dynamics in systems influenced by impactful events and prejudices. The Galam model is analyzed in detail, considering the dynamics that govern its behavior. Extensions to the model are discussed to address its limitations and enhance its applicability. The essay further engages in a discussion of the model, exploring its relevance in real-world scenarios. A case study of the  Trump 2016 election is examined to illustrate the model's utility. The conclusion offers a final discussion on the Galam model, its comparison to the models introduced in the lectures and its criticisms.
